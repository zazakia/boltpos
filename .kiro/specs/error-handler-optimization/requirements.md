# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current error handling utility in the Bolt POS application contains an extremely bloated error handler file with thousands of repetitive error code mappings. This creates maintenance issues, increases bundle size, and makes the codebase difficult to work with. This feature will optimize the error handling system to be more efficient and maintainable.

## Glossary

- **Error_Handler**: The utility module responsible for converting various error types into user-friendly messages
- **Supabase_Error**: Error objects returned by Supabase database operations
- **Error_Code_Mapping**: The system that maps specific error codes to user-friendly messages
- **Bundle_Size**: The total size of the compiled application code

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and maintainable error handling system, so that I can easily understand and modify error handling logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Error_Handler SHALL contain no more than 100 lines of code
2. THE Error_Handler SHALL maintain all existing functionality for error message extraction
3. THE Error_Handler SHALL use pattern matching instead of exhaustive case statements for similar error codes
4. THE Error_Handler SHALL preserve backward compatibility with existing error handling
5. THE Error_Handler SHALL reduce bundle size by at least 90% compared to the current implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive appropriate error messages, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Error_Handler SHALL return user-friendly messages for all Supabase error types
2. THE Error_Handler SHALL handle network errors with appropriate messaging
3. THE Error_Handler SHALL provide fallback messages for unknown error types
4. THE Error_Handler SHALL maintain consistent error message formatting
5. THE Error_Handler SHALL support error context information for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient error handling performance, so that error processing doesn't impact application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Error_Handler SHALL process errors in O(1) time complexity for common error types
2. THE Error_Handler SHALL use efficient pattern matching for error code ranges
3. THE Error_Handler SHALL minimize memory usage during error processing
4. THE Error_Handler SHALL cache frequently used error messages
5. THE Error_Handler SHALL avoid unnecessary string operations during error handling
